Notes about this simulation


- Values used for creating the initial conditions
  in GalactICs:


Total mass: 1e12 MSun
No. of Bulge particles: 10000
No. of  Disk particles: 10000
No. of Halo particles: 20000
Total simulated time: 2000 Myr


- Interesting results:
The main objective was to save the x-y positions in kpc as .csv
As that is more useful than the scatter plots.
